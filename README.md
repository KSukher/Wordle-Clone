# Wordle-Clone
A recreation of The New York Time's web-based word game "Wordle", with a few additional features.

Created using Javascript, HTML and CSS, this Wordle clone also provides options for either 4 or 5 letter words and choice of words source, whether that being the existing word banks or an API that pulls words from the [Letterpress word list](https://github.com/lorenbrichter/Words).

# How to Get Started
Once the project is cloned and opened in the desired IDE workspace, simply open the `index.html` file in the web browser and start playing.

For using the API word list, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) will be required for installing and running the API and local server.

Once Node.js is installed, the API must be downloaded. For this project an API called [an-array-of-english-words](https://www.npmjs.com/package/an-array-of-english-words) was used for the extended word bank option. (Link provides all information on the API)
