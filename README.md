# Wordle-Clone
A recreation of The New York Time's web-based word game "Wordle", with a few additional features.
Created using Javascript, HTML and CSS, this Wordle clone also provides options for either 4 or 5 letter words and choice of words source, whether that being the existing word banks or an API that pulls words from the [Letterpress word list](https://github.com/lorenbrichter/Words).
